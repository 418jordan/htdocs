    <p>I love to problem solve.  I usually can visualize the problem and the solution.  I like to create and fix things as well.  I like to do this as much as I can at work and at School that my wife has nicknamed me the "solutions engineer".  Its kind of our little joke but I truly enjoy finding solutions and making things work.  I have taken this mentality and I incorporate it into my code and design.  If there is a will there is a way and I enjoy greatly finding that way.  I have spent years working in different customer service, financial and retail backgrounds.  My unique work background and skill set allow me to have some different perspectives as a developer.  Apart from work I have many interests</p>

            <p>I love my family more then I can express!  They are my world.  I have been married for 5 years.  My children are growing up very fast.  Their ages are 3.5 years, 18 months and 2 months.  We try to spend as much quality time together as possible.  We like to be silly and go on adventures.</p>

            <p>I enjoy the outdoors.  I like to do almost anything outdoors.  As a family we like to camp, go on walks and hikes, swim, play all sorts of sports and garden.  This picture was taken at Arch's National Park.</p>

            <p>We love to travel!  Utah is an amazing place and we like to take full advantage of that.  We like to get up into the mountains often as well as Utah's national and state parks.  We have visited many of the great states of America.  We have been to Mexico and Hawaii and plan to continue broadening our horizons.  This photo was taken on our trip to Maui.</p>
